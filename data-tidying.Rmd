```{r}

library(tidyr)

Being specific about which version of filter, for example, you call is easy. To explicitly call a function by its unambiguous name, you use the syntax package_name::function_name(...). So, if I wanted to call the stats version of filter in this Rmarkdown document, I would use the syntax stats::filter(...).
package_name::function_name()
stats::filter()


## Data sources

Read in the data from the [KNB](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/df35b.304.2)

```{r}
catch_original <- read.csv("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1")
```
